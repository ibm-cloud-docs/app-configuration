# Why is the value returned for my targeted flag or property not what I expected?

Feature flag is targeted with segment rules. Rule execution is not as expected.
{: tsSymptoms}

Targeting assigns flag or property values to segments by evaluating rules.
{: tsCauses}

Targeting rules are executed in the order listed in the `Edit targeting` view. If a segment appears in more than one rule, only the value defined by the last rule is assigned.

Correct the order of evaluation by using the up- and down-arrows in the `Edit targeting` view, or remove the segment causing the unexpected outcome from rules.
