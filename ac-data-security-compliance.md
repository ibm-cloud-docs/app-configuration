{: shortdesc}

## Security readiness
{: #ac-security-readiness}

{{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} ensures security readiness by adhering to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} best practices for systems, networking, and secure engineering.

To learn more about security controls across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [How do I know that my data is safe?](/docs/overview?topic=overview-security#security){: external}.
{: tip}

To learn more about how your data is secured in {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}}, see [securing your data in {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}}](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-securing-your-data).

### Data encryption
{: #ac-data-encryption}

Access to {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} takes place over HTTPS and uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit.

For more information on supported TLS ciphers, see [TLS cipher support](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-cipher-support).

If you attempt to use a cipher that is not on this list, you may experience connectivity issues. Update your client to use one of the supported ciphers. If you are using `openssl`, you can use the command `openssl ciphers -v` at the command line (or, for some installations of `openssl`, use the `-s -v` options) to show a verbose list of what ciphers your client supports.
