# Working with Terraform in {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}}
{: #ac-tera-workwith}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="30m"}

This tutorial shows you how to use Terraform to configure files like `provider.tf` to declare {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} resources for deployment.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #ac-prereqs-terraform}

Ensure that the following prerequisites are in place:

* Install Terraform. For more information, see [Download Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install){: external}.
* Either deploy Terraform to a specific folder or add it to your `PATH`.

* Check your version of Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform â€“version
   ```
   {: codeblock}

* You need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If you don't have an account, then [Create an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/){: external}.
* Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
* Connect to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API Key. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access(IAM)**, and then select **API keys**. Create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API Key and save the password. For more information, see [Managing user API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui).

For more information about the terraform provider plug in, see [Installing the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-setup_cli#install_provider).
{: tip}

## Building Infrastructure-as-Code
{: #ac-infrastructure-as-code}
{: step}

Create a `tf-template` directory that contains the following Terraform configuration files:

### `provider.tf`
{: #ac-provider-tf}

`provider.tf` creates the required providers.

```hcl
terraform {
   required_providers {
      ibm        = {
         source  = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
         version = "1.57.0"
      }
   }
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `instance.tf`
{: #ac-instance-tf}

`instance.tf` provisions an {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} instance.

```hcl
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "terraform_demo" {
   plan     = "lite"
   location = "us-south"
   name     = "terraform_demo"
   service  = "apprapp"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `variables.tf`
{: #ac-variables-tf}

`variables.tf` stores passwords or other values that are required for Terraform at run time.

```hcl
variable "collection_name" {
	type        = string
	default     = "terraform_collection"
	description = "Collection name"
}

variable "collection_id" {
	type        = string
	default     = "collection123"
	description = "Collection ID"
}

variable "environment_id" {
	type        = string
	default     = "dev"
	description = "Environment ID"
}

variable "featureFlag_name" {
	type        = string
	default     = "terraform_featureFlag"
	description = "Feature flag name"
}

variable "featureFlag_type" {
	type        = string
	default     = "BOOLEAN"
	description = "Feature flag type"
}

variable "featureFlag_id" {
	type        = string
	default     = "featureFlag123"
	description = "Feature flag ID"
}

variable "featureFlag_enabled" {
	type        = string
	default     = "true"
	description = "Feature flag enabled value"
}

variable "featureFlag_disabled" {
	type        = string
	default     = "false"
	description = "Feature flag disabled value"
}

variable "featureFlag_rollout" {
	type        = string
	default     = "50"
	description = "Feature flag rollout percentage value"
}

variable "segment_name" {
	type        = string
	default     = "terraform_segment"
	description = "Segment name"
}

variable "segment_id" {
	type        = string
	default     = "s6"
	description = "Segment ID"
}

variable "segment_description" {
	type        = string
	default     = "testing segment create"
	description = "Description for the segment"
}

variable "attribute_values" {
	type        = list(any)
	default     = ["India", "UK"]
	description = "Values for segment attribute"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `collections.tf`
{: #ac-collections-tf}

`collections.tf` uses {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} to create collections.

```hcl
resource "ibm_app_config_collection" "app_config_collection" {
  guid          = ibm_resource_instance.terraform_demo.guid
  name          = var.collection_name
  description   = "Description for the collection"
  collection_id = var.collection_id
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `featureFlags.tf`
{: #ac-featureFlags-tf}

`featureFlags.tf` uses {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} to create feature flag.

```hcl
resource "ibm_app_config_feature" "app_config_feature" {
  guid               = ibm_resource_instance.terraform_demo.guid
  name               = var.featureFlag_name
  type               = var.featureFlag_type
  feature_id         = var.featureFlag_id
  enabled_value      = var.featureFlag_enabled
  environment_id     = var.environment_id
  disabled_value     = var.featureFlag_disabled
  rollout_percentage = var.featureFlag_rollout
}
```
{: codeblock}


### `segments.tf`
{: #ac-segments-tf}

`segments.tf` uses {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} to create segments.

```hcl
resource "ibm_app_config_segment" "app_config_create_segment" {
 guid            = ibm_resource_instance.terraform_demo.guid
 name            = var.segment_name
 description     = var.segment_description
 tags            = "t1"
 segment_id      = var.segment_id
 rules {
  attribute_name = "country"
  operator       = "contains"
  values         = var.attribute_values
 }
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Running your Terraform
{: #ac-execute-tf}
{: step}

Before running any Terraform scripts, learn about the following Terraform commands:

### Terraform **init**
{: #ac-init-tf}

The Terraform **init** command prepares the environment by ensuring the directory is properly configured:

```bash
bash-5.1# terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of ibm-cloud/ibm from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed ibm-cloud/ibm v1.56.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
{: codeblock}

### Terraform **plan**
{: #ac-plan-tf}

The Terraform **plan** command compares the declared resources with the state file to print the resources to be created, altered, or destroyed. This step shows you the impact of the resource files.

```bash
bash-5.1# terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # ibm_app_config_collection.app_config_collection will be created
  + resource "ibm_app_config_collection" "app_config_collection" {
      + collection_id    = "collection123"
