Feature flag is disabled and cannot be toggled.
{: tsSymptoms}

A Feature flag is linked to a collection and the flag is toggled per environment.
{: tsCauses}

If a feature flag is not linked to any collection, it is disabled by default.

Link the feature flag with an existing collection. This allows you to toggle between `ON` or `OFF` state.
