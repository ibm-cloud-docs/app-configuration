## Client-side and Server-side SDKs
{: #ac-sdk-types}

Understand the differences between the various SDKs so that you can decide between SDK types for your use case.

### Types of SDKs
{: #ac-sdk-types-of}

SDKs supported by {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} include:

- Server-side SDK
- Client-side SDK
- Admin SDK

SDKs that help evaluate feature flag and property values are broadly classified as Server-side or Client-side - based on the deployment environment. These SDKs can be integrated into your application to assess the feature or property values by considering segment targeting rules, if any.

Evaluation SDKs fetch the latest configuration data from the {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} service and ensure that any change in the service configuration is made available to your application in real time.

Admin SDKs can be used to create and manage configurations for Environments, Collections, Feature flags, Properties, and Segments. As an option to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI, Admin SDKs can be used to programmatically manage your service configuration from within your application.

The currently available Go language Admin SDK integrates with your Go application.
