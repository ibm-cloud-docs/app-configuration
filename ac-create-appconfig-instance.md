# Create an {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} service instance
{: #ac-create-an-instance}

{{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} provides capabilities to embark on a truly agile development methodology by separating feature rollouts from regular release cycles. {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} is a centralized feature management and configuration service for use with web and mobile applications, microservices, and distributed environments. Instrument your applications with {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} SDKs, and use the {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} dashboard or {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} administrator API to define features flags, which are organized into collections and targeted to segments. Change feature flag states in the cloud to activate or deactivate features in your application or environment, often without restarting.

You need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account to create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} service.
{: note}

To create an {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} service instance, follow these steps.

1. **Select a region** - Currently, the Dallas (`us-south`), London (`eu-gb`), and Sydney (`au-syd`) regions are supported.
1. **Select a pricing plan** - Currently, only Standard pricing plan is defined. The standard plan includes all the features that are enabled as on time. You can use simple and uniform ReST APIs to configure, enable, segment, and monitor features to mobile devices and web applications.
1. **Configure your resource** with a **Service name**, or use the preset name.
1. **Select a resource group** - The resource group selection helps how you want resources to be organized in your account. The resource group that you select cannot be changed after the service instance is created.
1. Optionally, define **Tags** that are required to identify this service instance. If your tags are billing related, consider writing tags as *key:value* pairs to help group-related tags, such as `costctr:124`.
1. Click **Create**. A new service instance is created and the {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} console displayed.
